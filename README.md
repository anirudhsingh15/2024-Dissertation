Studying the correlation between serum vitamin D and calcium with insulin resistance in children with type 1 diabetes and  identification of gene clusters associated with serum vitamin D and calcium with insulin resistance.

Aim: To identify gene clustsers associated with serum vitamin D and calcium with insulin resistance.

Data type: Clinical data. Available on request.

Packages used: Refer the scripts (libraries)

About the scripts :

Statistical analyses : The clinical data post cleaning was subjected to correlation and ANOVA tests.

WGCNA : the outlier datasets were removed and gene custers were made. The modules were related with traits and genes correlated to vitamin D, calcium and estimated insulin sensitivity were extracted.
